                <p>As Dakota grew, people could observe her kind-heartedness in everything she did, she always hung out with two people, Gary Oak son of Blue Oak, and Leaf Green, daughter of Red and Green. The three followed their parents' footsteps and began on their own Pokémon journeys, at the age of ten, along with Yellow. At the Indigo League, only Dakota and Gary were present, and when asked why, Oak had no answer for Leaf. He told Dakota that, Yellow stopped training, thinking she was weak, but the truth is, she died, in the hands of Team Rocket.

When she lost in the league, Dakota's mother lost faith in her. She requested Gary to tell her to stop training, but Gary knows Dakota's passion, and decided against it, instead he encouraged Dakota. Throughout her journeys, Dakota met people who helped her in tough times, but this time was a bit different, in Kalos, she met a person she hasn't seen for eight years, Sen Yvonne, the boy she helped when she was six. The two started to develop an interest in each other, but both being timid, did not reveal it. In the Kalos league, Dakota was one step closer to victory. On the last day of their journey together, Sen, in a way, confessed his love to Dakota. But in every journey as much as she made friends, she even made enemies, all being the leaders of criminal organizations...</p>
